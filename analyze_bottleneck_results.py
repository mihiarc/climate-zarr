BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS RESULTS
============================================================

The profiling reveals that the MAJOR BOTTLENECK is I/O operations:

1. I/O Operations: 24.9 seconds (99.9%)
   - tas_weighted_mean:    6.187s (24.8%)
   - tasmin_weighted_mean: 6.155s (24.7%)
   - tasmax_weighted_mean: 6.133s (24.6%)
   - pr_weighted_mean:     5.946s (23.8%)

2. Actual Computations: 0.011s (0.04%)
   - All calculations are nearly instantaneous

3. File Opening: 0.488s (2.0%)
   - Opening 4 NetCDF files takes ~0.5 seconds

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Each variable takes ~6 seconds to read and compute spatial average
- Total of ~25 seconds to process ONE county for ONE year
- Only 4 pixels (2x2) are being read, but entire chunks must be loaded
- The actual data volume is tiny (0.02 MB), but NetCDF must read larger chunks

============================================================
EXTRAPOLATION TO FULL DATASET
============================================================

For the full dataset:
- Counties: 3,200+
- Years: 91 (2010-2100)
- Total county-years: ~291,200

Sequential processing time:
- 25 seconds × 291,200 = 7,280,000 seconds
- = 121,333 minutes
- = 2,022 hours
- = 84 days

With parallel processing (56 CPUs):
- Theoretical best: 84 days / 56 = 1.5 days
- Realistic (80% efficiency): ~2 days

============================================================
OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
============================================================

1. REORGANIZE DATA STRUCTURE (Biggest Impact)
   - Current: Data organized by year files (365 days × 600 lat × 1440 lon)
   - Better: Reorganize by spatial chunks or time series
   - Pre-aggregate to annual values if daily data not needed

2. USE ZARR FORMAT
   - Zarr allows efficient chunked access
   - Can read only the exact pixels needed
   - Would reduce I/O from 6s to <0.1s per variable

3. PRE-PROCESS COUNTY MEANS
   - Pre-calculate county spatial averages for all variables
   - Store as time series per county
   - Reduces data volume by 1000x

4. MEMORY CACHING
   - Load all data for a year into memory once
   - Process all counties from memory
   - Current approach reloads for each county

5. USE DASK
   - Lazy loading and smart chunking
   - Better memory management
   - Can process larger-than-memory datasets

============================================================
RECOMMENDED APPROACH
============================================================

Short term (minimal changes):
1. Modify process_year() to load data once and process all counties
2. This alone would give 3000x speedup

Medium term:
1. Convert data to Zarr format with appropriate chunking
2. Expected processing time: < 1 hour for full dataset

Long term:
1. Pre-aggregate annual summaries during data preparation
2. Store as county time series
3. Expected processing time: < 10 minutes for full dataset
