# climate_output_format.yaml
# YAML configuration for final climate output file format
# Defines columns, types, and example values for each field
#
# NOTE: No unit conversions are required. The column names include units
# (e.g., "1in", "90F") for user clarity, but the actual values stored are
# simply counts of days meeting those thresholds. Temperature and precipitation
# values can remain in their original units (Celsius/mm or Fahrenheit/inches).
